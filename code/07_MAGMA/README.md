# Generalized Gene-Set Analysis of GWAS Data (MAGMA) ToDo

Describe here 

* [`01_Input_GWAS_data.R`](01_Input_GWAS_data.R): 
    GWAS results from 6 different studies previously formatted and prepared for MAGMA by [Louise Huuki-Myers](https://lahuuki.github.io) in the [Habenula Pilot LIBD project](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/Habenula_Pilot/tree/master) were explored and further processed to use as input for MAGMA analysis:

     * **GWAS SZC data**:
     * **GWAS MDD data**:
     * **GWAS Panic data**:
     * **GWAS SUD data**:
     * **GWAS MDD data (2)**:
     * **GWAS OUD data**:
 
    For each dataset, the `.snploc` file with the position of the SNPs were generated, as well as the `.pval` file containing the *p*-values of the SNPs for their association with the phenotype.
