# Supplementary Tables


## [Supplementary Table 1](TableS1_sample_variables_dictionary.tsv)

**Dictionary of sample variables.**

Meaning of the sample (or rat) variables and sample-level quality control metrics used throughout this project.



## [Supplementary Table 2](TableS2_sample_metadata_and_QCmetrics.tsv)

**Sample metadata and QC metrics.**

Sample-level metadata and quality control data used for EDA and DGE. See [Table SA](stabl_sample_variables_dictionary.tsv) for the description of these variables. 

Created [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/fentanyl_rat_hb_amy/blob/e081ddd5a05334d9990002b9d441ba4bc8cd3651/code/04_EDA/01_QCA.R#L69).



## [Supplementary Table 3](TableS3_rat_behavioral_data.tsv)

**Rat behavioral data.**

Data regarding the behavior of fentanyl and saline rats. See [Table SA]([stabl_sample_variables_dictionary]) for the description of these variables. 

Maybe not necessary: Created [here]().



## [Supplementary Table 4](TableS4_de_genes_Substance_habenula.tsv)

**DEGs for substance in habenula**

Metadata, *limma* DE statistics, and Ensembl associated phenotypes and descriptions of DEGs obtained for fentanyl vs. saline in habenula. See [_limma_](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) documentation for these statistics definitions. Volcano plot in **Figure XX** was created with the data provided in this table.

## [Supplementary Table 5](TableS5_de_genes_Substance_amygdala.tsv)

**DEGs for substance in amygdala**

Metadata, *limma* DE statistics, and Ensembl associated phenotypes and descriptions of DEGs obtained for fentanyl vs. saline in amygdala. See [_limma_](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) documentation for these statistics definitions. Volcano plot in **Figure XX** was created with the data provided in this table.

## [Supplementary Table 6](TableS6_DEAs_results_all_genes_hab_amyg.tsv)

**Results for all DGE analyses and genes in habenula and amygdala** 

Gene-level metadata and *limma* DE statistics of each gene for substance and rat behavior DEG analyses (fentanyl vs. saline, first hour infusion slope, total intake, and last session intake) in habenula and amygdala. See [_limma_](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) documentation for these statistics definitions. Scatter plots in **Figure XX** were created with the data provided in this table.
