# Supplementary Tables
TODO: add Tables S1,S2 to supp tables
TODO: add number of figs where these tables were used. 


## [Supplementary Table 1](TableS1_sample_variables_dictionary.tsv)

**Dictionary of sample variables.**

Meaning of the sample (or rat) variables and sample-level quality control metrics used throughout this project.



## [Supplementary Table 2](TableS2_sample_metadata_and_QCmetrics.tsv)

**Sample metadata and QC metrics.**

Sample-level metadata and quality control data used for EDA and DGE, as well as data regarding the behavior of fentanyl and saline rats. See [Table S1](stabl_sample_variables_dictionary.tsv) for the description of these variables.

## [Supplementary Table 3](TableS3_de_genes_Substance_habenula.tsv)

**DEGs for substance in habenula**

Metadata, *limma* DE statistics, and Ensembl associated phenotypes and descriptions of DEGs obtained for fentanyl vs. saline in habenula. See [_limma_](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) documentation for these statistics definitions. Volcano plot in **Figure XX** was created with the data provided in this table.
